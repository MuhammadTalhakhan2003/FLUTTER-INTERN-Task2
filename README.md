Explanation
File Handling Functions:

writeToFile(String filename, List<String> data): Handles writing a list of strings to a file and triggers a download.
readFromFile(): Reads a file selected by the user and returns its contents as a list of strings.
Data Processing Function:

processFileData(): Processes the data by reversing each line and writing it to a new file.
Error Handling:

Each function includes error handling to manage issues like file not found or reading errors.
Testing:

The functions can be tested by clicking the respective buttons in the Flutter app. To test:
Use the "Write to File" button to create a file with sample data.
Use the "Process File Data" button to reverse the lines of the file and save it as a new file.
Documentation:

Each function includes a comment block explaining its purpose and parameters/returns.
Testing
For thorough testing, you might want to manually test the functionality in a browser environment. Automated testing for file handling in a web app typically involves simulating user interactions with file inputs, which can be complex and is often done in integration tests or through manual testing.

This setup ensures that the code is modular, well-documented, and includes functionality that can be tested in your Flutter web application.
